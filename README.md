# pixelify
Image processor that applies filters to images using CUDA. 

# TODO:

## must haves:
- parse filter file -> get filter array of pixels 
- imgui implementation
- test cases for all cases
- support anti-aliasing methods + other applications aside from filters?

## would be nice to haves:
- cuda <--> amd, work on any GPU, maybe use HIP or some transpiling method
